# About me

My name is Eduardo Rodriguez.

I am a full-stack web developer currently living in Munich, Germany.

I fluently speak Spanish, German, English and Catalan.

In my day-to-day work I mostly do backend stuff in **Go**, use **Postgres**, write infrastructure as code in **Terraform** (using AWS and/or Azure) and do some frontend stuff with React.

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/erodrigufer)
