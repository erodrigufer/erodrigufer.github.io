# About me

My name is Eduardo Rodriguez.

I am a full-stack software engineer currently working at [they consulting](https://www.they-consulting.de/).

I fluently speak Spanish, German, English and Catalan.

In my day-to-day work I mostly do backend stuff in **Go**, use **Postgres**, write infrastructure as code in **Terraform** (for AWS and/or Azure) and do some frontend stuff with React.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/erodrigufer) and you can contact me at `blog [at] erodriguez.de`
