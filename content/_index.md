# About me

My name is Eduardo Rodriguez.

I am a full-stack software engineer currently working at [they consulting](https://www.they-consulting.de/).

I fluently speak Spanish, German, English and Catalan.

(I am also just starting to learn Japanese: こんにちわエドアルドです。)

---

In my day-to-day work I mostly do backend stuff in **Go** (五), use **Postgres**, write infrastructure as code in **Terraform** (for AWS and/or Azure) and do some frontend stuff with React in TS.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/erodrigufer), 🟧 [the orange site](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RapperWhoMadeIt) and 🦞[Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/~eduard).
